twig-lint - Standalone twig linter
==================================

twig-lint is a lint tool for your twig files.

It can be useful to integrate in your ci setup or as the basis of editor plugins (e.g. [syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) for Vim).

        "asm89/twig-lint": "*"
    }
}
```

Run `./bin/twig-lint lint <file>`.

### As standalone executable

Install as a global composer dependency:

```bash
composer global require "asm89/twig-lint" "@stable"
```

Run `~/.composer/vendor/bin/twig-lint lint <file>`.

### Vim and Syntastic configuration

For the standalone executable, add the following to your `~/.vimrc` file:

```vim
let g:syntastic_twig_twiglint_exec = 'php'
let g:syntastic_twig_twiglint_exe = 'php /path/to/twig-lint'
```

For the composer dependency, twig-lint must be in your `$PATH`, no further
configuration is needed.
